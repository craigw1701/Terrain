# Terrain

A simple terrain program in OpenGL.

The plan is to spend 4-8 hours on each area beofre moving on, allowing me to get basic versions of everything working and making it easy to change how things work as I learn more.

* Terrain
* Water
* Sky
* Grass
* Trees
* Shadows
* Post Processing effects
* Roads
* Cities/Houses
* Rain/Snow
